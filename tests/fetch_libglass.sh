# fetch_libglass.sh - Clone LibGlass-1.0 at the ref .pkgmeta pins, and prove
# the checkout IS that ref. CI runs it before the tests (they load the library
# from $LIBGLASS); it also works locally from git bash.
#
# The url and the pin are read from .pkgmeta, the one place they are written,
# so CI tests exactly what the packager will embed.
#
# Usage (from the repo root):  bash tests/fetch_libglass.sh <dest>
#
# <dest> must not exist: the script never deletes anything (a default of
# ../LibGlass would have wiped the dev checkout, uncommitted work included).
